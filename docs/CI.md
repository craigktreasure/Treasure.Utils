# Continuous integration

[![CI Build](https://github.com/craigktreasure/Treasure.Utils/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/craigktreasure/Treasure.Utils/actions/workflows/CI.yml)

The [CI Build](https://github.com/craigktreasure/Treasure.Utils/actions/workflows/CI.yml) will always build, but will only release when "do release" is included in the commit message.
